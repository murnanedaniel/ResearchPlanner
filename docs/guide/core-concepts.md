# Core Concepts

## Graph-Based Planning

ResearchGraph uses a graph-based approach to research planning, where:
- **Nodes** represent research components, tasks, or milestones
- **Edges** represent relationships or dependencies between components
- **Subgraphs** allow hierarchical organization of research elements

## Timeline Integration

The timeline feature provides:
- Temporal organization of research components
- Multiple time scales (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Automatic date management and visualization
- Drag-and-drop scheduling

## Node Types

Nodes can represent various research elements:
- Research tasks
- Experiments
- Publications
- Milestones
- Resources
- Team members

Each node contains:
- Title
- Description (with rich text support)
- Timeline position
- Hierarchical relationships
- Custom metadata

## Edge System

Edges in ResearchGraph can represent:
- Dependencies
- Influences
- Relationships
- Data flow
- Resource allocation

Edge properties include:
- Type
- Description
- Status (planned/completed)
- Direction

## Hierarchical Organization

The subgraph system enables:
- Nested organization of research components
- Collapsible/expandable nodes
- Visual grouping with hulls
- Multi-level hierarchies

## State Management

ResearchGraph maintains:
- Persistent graph state
- Undo/redo history
- Selection state
- Timeline configuration
- View settings
