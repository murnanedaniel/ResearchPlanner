- Create and connect research nodes visually
- Organize research components hierarchically
- Use the timeline for temporal planning
- Create nested subgraphs for complex projects
- Leverage AI assistance for planning

## Key Features

### Node-Based Planning
Create nodes representing research components, experiments, papers, or any other research artifacts. Each node can contain rich text descriptions, links, and metadata.

### Dynamic Timeline Integration
Organize your research along a flexible timeline that automatically adapts to your planning needs. Switch between daily, weekly, and monthly views to get the right perspective.

### Hierarchical Organization
Group related research components into subgraphs that can be expanded or collapsed. This hierarchical organization helps manage complex research projects with multiple interconnected parts.

### Smart Edge System
Connect nodes with meaningful relationships. Edges can represent dependencies, influences, or any other type of connection between research components.

### AI Assistance
Get intelligent suggestions for research planning, node organization, and documentation using integrated AI features.
