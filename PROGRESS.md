# Autocomplete Feature Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Basic Selection & UI ✓

### 1. Selection UI ✓
- [x] Add autocomplete mode state to ResearchPlanner
- [x] Add selected start/goal nodes state
- [x] Add selection mode state (start vs goal selection)

### 2. UI Controls ✓
- [x] Add Autocomplete button to Toolbar
- [x] Add Start/Goal selection sub-buttons
- [x] Implement visual feedback for selected nodes

### 3. Node Positioning Logic ✓
- [x] Implement calculateIntermediatePosition function
- [x] Add position calculation to node creation

### 4. API Integration ✓
- [x] Create OpenAI API route
- [x] Implement prompt construction
- [x] Add response parsing
- [x] Connect API to UI

### 5. Testing Implementation ✓
- [x] Set up Jest and React Testing Library
- [x] Add API route tests
- [x] Add Node component tests
- [x] Add Toolbar component tests
- [x] Fix test configuration issues

## Phase 2: Enhanced Functionality

### 1. Multi-Node Selection & Deletion ✓
- [x] Implement Ctrl+drag selection box
- [x] Add multi-node selection state
- [x] Add bulk deletion with Delete key
- [x] Ensure proper state persistence after deletion
- [x] Preserve existing node styling and UI

### 2. Context-Aware AI Integration
- [ ] Send full graph structure to API for better context
- [ ] Include node relationships and dependencies
- [ ] Consider graph history in suggestions
- [ ] Improve prompt engineering for more relevant steps

### 3. Improved Node Creation UX
- [ ] Implement smart node positioning to prevent overlaps
- [ ] Add sequential fade-in animations for new nodes
- [ ] Smooth transitions for node placement
- [ ] Visual feedback during node generation process 

### 4. Subgraph Functionality
- [ ] Add subnode creation option
- [ ] Add "explode" option to view subnodes (and hide parent)
- [ ] Add "hide" option to hide subnodes (and show parent), using "esc" key to toggle
