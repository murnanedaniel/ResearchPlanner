# Sprint 2 Review

## ðŸŽ¯ Completed Items

### 1. Edge Management
- Implemented edge creation system (see `ResearchPlanner.tsx` lines 85-102)
- Added edge visualization with SVG lines and arrowheads (`NodeGraph.tsx` lines 40-108) 
- Implemented edge selection and editing
- Added edge titles and descriptions with consistent state management
- Added planned/obsolete status tracking (`EdgeDialog.tsx` lines 31-38)

### 2. State Management Improvements
- Unified node and edge selection system
- Standardized title property across nodes and edges (`types/index.ts`)
- Consistent title/description handling between nodes and edges
- Improved state transitions when switching between selected items
- Standardized property naming (title for both nodes and edges)

### 3. UI Components Enhancement
- Enhanced SidePanel to handle both nodes and edges uniformly
- Implemented EdgeDialog with planned/obsolete status tracking
- Added visual feedback for edge selection
- Improved placeholder text consistency

### 4. Type System Refinement
- Standardized node and edge interfaces (see `types/index.ts` lines 1-20)
- Consistent property naming across types
- Added support for planned/obsolete status on edges
- Maintained extensibility for future properties

## ðŸš€ Current Functionality

The app now allows users to:
1. Create and manage both nodes and edges
2. Edit titles and descriptions for both nodes and edges uniformly
3. Create connections between nodes with optional titles
4. Track planned vs actual paths through edge properties
5. Select and edit both nodes and edges through a unified interface
6. Maintain consistent state across all interactions

## ðŸ“‹ Proposed Next Steps

### 1. Node Recursion
- Implement double-click to zoom into node
- Create nested project graphs
- Navigation between different levels
- Breadcrumb trail for current depth

### 2. File Attachments
- Complete FileAttachments component
- File upload functionality
- File type categorization
- File preview and download

### 3. Layout Improvements
- Enhance automatic tree layout
- Add layout controls
- Add zoom and pan controls
- Implement node collapsing

### 4. Visual Enhancements
- Add visual distinction for planned vs obsolete edges
- Implement edge routing to avoid node overlaps
- Add animation for state transitions
- Improve edge label positioning

### 5. Data Persistence
- Implement save/load functionality
- JSON export/import
- Auto-save feature
- Version history
