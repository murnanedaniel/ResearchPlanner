## 🎮 Usage

### Creating Nodes
1. Enter a title in the toolbar
2. Click "Add Node" or press Enter
3. Double-click nodes to edit details
4. Drag nodes to reposition

### Creating Connections
1. Click "Create Edge" in the toolbar
2. Select source node
3. Select target node
4. Edge is created with directional arrow

### Using AI Assistance
1. Click "Autocomplete" in the toolbar
2. Select a start node (highlighted in emerald)
3. Select a goal node (highlighted in blue)
4. AI will generate intermediate steps with proper spacing
5. Edit or refine generated steps as needed

### Managing Subgraphs
1. Select multiple nodes with Ctrl+drag
2. Enter a title for the parent node
3. Click "Collapse to Node" to create a subgraph
4. Use ESC key to quickly collapse expanded nodes
5. Click the expand button to view subnodes

### Multi-Select Operations
1. Hold Ctrl and drag to select multiple nodes
2. Use Delete key to remove selected nodes
3. Selection state persists for bulk operations
4. Drag any selected node to move the entire selection

## 🛠 Configuration

### OpenAI Settings
Modify \`app/api/autocomplete/route.ts\` to adjust:
- Model selection (GPT-4o-mini)
- Temperature and other parameters
- Prompt engineering

### Graph Settings
Adjust \`components/ResearchPlanner/constants.ts\` for:
- Node sizes and spacing
- Edge appearance
- Animation timings
- Layout parameters
